# Goproject
## Introduction
This is a personal Golang project. It is designed to get me back into
development work. It is also about developing my GitHub profile a bit more.
So with that in mind. You are ensourgaged to Fork , Pull , copy and use this
as you see fit. I will document the work and how to set it up.
